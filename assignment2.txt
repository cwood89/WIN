1. Build out the file paths in the image. 
	- done

2. If I start in my root directory (in this case it is called directories). How would I navigate to the
directory called food?
	- cd images/clipart/food

3. From food, how would I navigate to Poe, EdgarAllen?
	- cd ../../../e-texts/Poe,EdgarAllan/

4. How would I be able to tell the contents of Poe, EdgarAllen?
	- ls

5. Navigate to images, and use the command that will tell you the exact path of where you are.
	- cd ../../images && pwd

6. While in images, create a folder called photographs.
	- mkdir photographs

7. Navigate to your new directory, and create a new file called sunrise. Oh, and make it a .jpg file.
(Windows get a freebie here).
	- cd photgraphs && touch sunrise.jpg

8. Now move that file back one directory.
	- mv sunrise.jpg ../

9. Change directories to the like folder under monkeys. Open this folder in sublime.
	 - cd ../../Monkeys/like

10. Bonus! Remove the bananas.html file from the like folder.
	- rm bananas.html
