## User stories

	 As a [type of user], I want [some feature] so that [some reason].

- Only write about about 1 piece of functionality, keep it short!
- Write from the perspective of the user.
- Limit scope and keep it small.

As a College student, I want to be able to enter a price so that I can find whats in my price range.

As a small buisness owner I want to narrow down type of computer/software by industry so I can find what best best fits my needs.

As a unsure buyer I want to search by rating to find the most popular items.

As a mobile user I would like auto complete my search to save time.

As a gamer I want to search by hardware to get a capable pc.

## Scrum Master

- Prioritizes User Stories
- Arranges them into sprints
- Schedules and assigns Sprints
- Holds daily scrum meetings during sprint
	- what were you able to get done
	- what obstacles did face
- Holds a Retrospective at the end of a sprint
	- do we need to adjust
	- what could we have done better

## Acceptance Critera

- Intent: the end result
- Solution: the actual tools to accomplish our intent

## Estimation

- how much development is it going to take
- how long is it going to take

- Story Points: abstract value representing the difficulty of the task.
 	- Fibonacci Sequence. The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
 	- the higher the number the harder the task

- Hours of development
 	- 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, 10 days, 30 days -- time frame buckets
 	- easier to translate difficuly
 	- always round up to next "bucket"
